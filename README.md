## Hi! I'm Kosei 👋

I've been learning programming simply because I enjoy making things.  
But recently, I focused too much on AI, productivity, and monetization —  
and I realized that coding was becoming less fun than before.

So I decided to return to what I really love: **enjoying programming**.

I'm now exploring the world of **Open Source**.  
I want to contribute — even in small ways — to the engineering community  
that has helped me grow so much.

I'm still a student and still learning,  
but I hope to develop by collaborating with others  
and by writing code that becomes useful to someone, somewhere.

If you want to talk or ask something,  
**feel free to open an issue**.  
I'm always happy to connect with other developers!
